## Why a copy of my Identity Document

In the case of an Insurance claim, proper identification is required. Cross Border documentation needs to be 100% accurate to ensure a trouble-free transit through the border.

## Why a copy of my Drivers License
 
For trailers with a GVM above 750kg, a Code EB license is a requirement both legally and for Insurance purposes. Code B licenses are sufficient for trailers with a GVM of less than 750kg.

## Collection and Delivery
 
Before collection you will be contacted by the owner and a time scheduled for collection will be arranged by both parties. Some owners offer a delivery service as well as a setup service.

## What about the cleaning?
 
You will receive a clean camper, owners have the option to add a cleaning fee to the rental or waive it. Generally, return a rental the way you would like to receive it. 

---

## When should I book my trip?
 
That depends on the time of the year that you need the camper, during school holidays or not. While our customers book campers for the school holidays up to a year in advance, you will mostly get a camper for a weekend on shorter notice. Also, look for specials. Generally, it's easier for you to get hold of a camper when you do not rely on travelling during school holidays.

## What requirements are mandatory in regards to towing?
 
The South African law looks without exception at the tare weight of your car, not at your vehicle's engine capacity. The minimum tare weight must exceed that of the trailer. You will find the tare weight on your license disk on the windscreen. Your vehicle must also be rated for the towing of the respective weight by the car's manufacturer.

On collection, this remains the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the renter has the correct drivers license (Appropriate Code and that the License has not expired or will not expire during the trip) and that the vehicle used for towing does comply with the Law of South Africa and the destination country. The owner should not release their camper to the renter if this is not in order as no Insurance claim can be submitted if this has not been checked by Kampi.co.za and the owner of the camper

## What driver’s license do I need?
 
You need an EB, EC, or EC1 license to tow braked trailers legally. If The GVM (Gross vehicle mass) of the trailer is more than 750kg you will need an EB, EC, or EC1 license.

## What speed do you recommend?
