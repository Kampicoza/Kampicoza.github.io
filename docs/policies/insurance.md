# Section 1: Insurance Terms and Conditions

## Comprehensive Insurance Coverage

[Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"}, through our brokers, offers comprehensive insurance
coverage for all rentals where the owner has opted in to our insurance
when listing with [Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"}, and it covers damages to the camper.

## Deposit

To secure the rental, [Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"} requests a deposit of R5000 for local
trips and R10000 for cross-border trips. In the event of an insurance
claim, the R5000 deposit will be used to cover upto R5000 of the excess. The
excess of R5000 will apply to each incident. If multiple incidents
occur, the excess will be multiplied by the number of incidents and will
not be covered by [Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"}. The excess is the responsibility of the
owner of the camper.

## Excess

 - Excess Amount
In the event of an insurance claim, an excess amount shall apply. The excess represents the portion of the claim that the renter or owner is responsible for. For each incident, the excess will be either R5000 or 10% of the total claim amount, whichever is greater.

 - Calculation of Excess
The excess for a claim will be determined by comparing the actual claim amount to the two aforementioned options: R5000 or 10% of the total claim amount. The higher value between the two shall be considered the applicable excess for the claim.

 - Application of Excess
The excess amount shall be deducted from any payment made by Kampi.co.za for the claim. It is the responsibility of the renter or owner to cover the excess before receiving any compensation for the claim.

 - Multiple Incidents
In the case of multiple incidents occurring during the rental period, each incident will have its own separate excess amount calculated based on the total claim amount associated with that particular incident. The excess will be applied individually to each incident, thereby ensuring the proportional allocation of responsibility.

## Market Value of the Camper

The total amount that [Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"} is liable to pay in the event of a
claim is equal to the reasonable market value of the camper as specified
by the owner. However, overinflating the value of the camper could
result in a loss of cover.

## Responsibility of Owner and Renter

To ensure cover, the owner is responsible for ensuring that the driver
and renter are fully licensed with the correct license to tow the
camper. The towing vehicle\'s license must also be up to date for the
duration of the trip. The renter will accept responsibility for all
damages once they take possession of the camper.

## Claims Process

If a claim needs to be submitted, an email must be sent to
insurance@[Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"} with a copy of the Hand Over document, pictures of
the damages, and a minimum of two separate repair quotes. [Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"}
will then issue a claim form that must be completed by the owner and
signed by the renter.

## Limitations and Exclusions

Insurance coverage does not extend to damages caused by the renter\'s
negligence, intentional acts, or breach of the rental agreement.
Additionally, [Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"} is not liable for any loss of personal
property that occurs during the rental period. Any exclusions or
limitations will be outlined in the rental agreement.

## Liability

[Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"} is not liable for any loss or damages arising from the use
of a rental camper, including but not limited to any accidents,
injuries, or loss of property, whether caused by the renter, the owner,
or any third party. The renter agrees to indemnify [Kampi.co.za](https://kampi.co.za){:target="_blank"} against
any such claims, losses, or damages.

## Local Laws

These insurance terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the
Republic of South Africa and any disputes arising out of or in
connection with these terms and conditions shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the South African courts.
