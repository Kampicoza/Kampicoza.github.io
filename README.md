## What is Kampi.co.za
Kampi.co.za is South Africa's first person to person, (Peer to Peer), camping rental platform. Thousands of campers have caravans which they can convert into real assets, adding money to their pockets. Instead of being an underutilised luxury, owners can now earn R300-R600 per R100 000 of their vehicle's value, per day. Current listings vary in price from R250 per day to almost R2500 per day. Like renting out a vacation home, renting out your caravan on Kampi.co.za can take care of annual maintenance, and even pay for vacations.
